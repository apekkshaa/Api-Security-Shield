# API Security Shield

**API Security Shield** is a comprehensive platform designed to help developers and security teams manage, monitor, and secure their API infrastructure. This application provides an intuitive interface for tracking API usage, performing security scans, and receiving real-time notifications about potential security threats. Built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), API Security Shield is designed to be scalable and easy to integrate into existing workflows.

## Overview

API Security Shield offers a centralized platform where developers and security professionals can effectively manage their APIs, ensuring that they remain secure and functional. The platform is designed to handle a large number of APIs, providing a comprehensive view of their status, security, and usage.

## What the Project Does

### API Inventory Management

API Security Shield helps you maintain an organized inventory of all your APIs. Each API entry includes detailed information, such as the API name, endpoint, description, and associated metadata. This centralized inventory makes it easy to monitor and manage APIs across your entire infrastructure.

### Security Scans

The platform allows you to perform automated security scans on your APIs. These scans are designed to detect common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure configurations. After each scan, you receive a detailed report highlighting potential risks and recommendations for remediation.

### Real-time Notifications

API Security Shield ensures that you are always informed about the state of your APIs. You receive real-time notifications whenever a security scan is completed, when new APIs are added to the inventory, or when a potential security threat is detected. Notifications can be configured based on severity levels, allowing you to prioritize your response.

### User Management and Roles

The platform includes robust user management features, allowing administrators to create and manage users with different roles. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive features, such as security scans and API management.

### Customizable Settings

API Security Shield provides a settings page where you can customize the platform to suit your needs. This includes configuring scan frequencies, notification preferences, and user permissions. The settings are designed to be flexible, allowing you to tailor the platform to your specific security requirements.
